			<p class="prayer-text">
				Our saintcel who art in heaven, <br />
				Hallowed be thy frame. <br />
				Thy inceldom come, <br />
				Thy pill be swallowed, <br />
				IRL as it is online. <br />
				Give us this day our daily life fuel <br />
				And forgive us our copes <br />
				As we forgive those <br />
				Who attempt to cope <br />
				And lead us not into roping, <br />
				But deliver us the whitepill. <br />
				For thine is inceldom <br />
				And the coping, and the ugly, <br />
				For ever and ever.  <br />
				<br />
				Amen. <br />
